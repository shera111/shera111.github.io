                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <div class="ct">
                            Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran superfamily Papilionoidea, known for
                            their
                            large,
                            often
                            brightly colored wings and fluttering flight. The oldest butterfly fossils date back to the
                            Paleocene,
                            about
                            56 million years ago, although molecular evidence suggests they likely originated in the
                            Cretaceous.

                            Butterflies undergo a four-stage life cycle, including egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa
                            (chrysalis),
                            and
                            adult. Some species have multiple generations per year, while others, especially in colder
                            climates,
                            may
                            take several years to complete their cycle.

                            Many butterflies are polymorphic and use camouflage, mimicry, or aposematism to avoid
                            predators.
                            Some
                            species, like the monarch and painted lady, migrate long distances. Butterflies also face
                            predation
                            from
                            parasites and other animals.

                            Culturally, butterflies are a popular symbol in art and literature, often considered one of
                            nature's
                            most
                            appealing creatures.

                        <div class="ct">
                            The earliest Lepidoptera fossils date to the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, around 200 million
                            years
                            ago. Butterflies evolved from moths, so while the butterflies are monophyletic (forming a
                            single
                            clade), the moths are not. The oldest known butterfly is Protocoeliades kristenseni from the
                            Palaeocene aged Fur Formation of Denmark, approximately 55 million years old, which belongs
                            to the
                            family Hesperiidae (skippers). Molecular clock estimates suggest that butterflies originated
                            sometime in the Late Cretaceous, but only significantly diversified during the Cenozoic,
                            with one
                            study suggesting a North American origin for the group.The oldest American butterfly is the
                            Late
                            Eocene Prodryas persephone from the Florissant Fossil Beds, approximately 34 million years
                            old.<br><br>

                        <div class="ct">
                            Butterflies are divided into six families that contain a total of about 20,000
                            species.<br><br><br>
                            Traditionally, butterflies have been divided into the superfamilies Papilionoidea and the
                            moth-like
                            Hedyloidea. Recent work has discovered that Hedylidae, the only family within Hedyloidea, is
                            nested
                            within
                            the Papilionoidea, meaning that Papilionoidea would be synonymous with Rhopalocera. The
                            relationships
                            between the rest of the 6 families are extremely well resolved, which is summarized in the

                The life cycle of a butterfly is a fascinating journey of transformation. They go through four different
                stages in their life cycle, each a vital part of its development. Let's explore the key stages that make
                up
                the butterfly's life cycle!
            </div>

                        <h2>Egg</h2>
                        <div class="ct">
                            The life cycle starts with the adult female butterfly laying a cluster of small, round eggs
                            on
                            plants,
                            which become food for the tiny worm-like caterpillars that hatch 4-6 days after they are
                            laid.

                        <h2>Adult</h2>
                        <div class="ct">
                            In this stage, the chrysalis opens, and the adult butterfly or imago comes out. The adult
                            butterfly
                            has
                            long antennae, long legs, and compound eyes. When it first emerges from the chrysalis, its
                            long,
                            colorful wings are damp, soft, and are folded against the body. The butterfly rests and
                            waits
                            for
                            the
                            wings to dry. Once fit for its first flight, the butterfly takes off in search of
                            nectar-producing
                            flowers. Adult females fly from one place to another to find plants suitable for laying
                            eggs.
                            While
                            most
                            butterflies live for 1-2 weeks, some species spend the winter as hibernating adults,
                            surviving
                            for
                            several months.

                        The butterfly closely resembles the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) of the Americas. The
                        wingspan
                        is 70 to 95 millimetres (2.8 to 3.7 in). Both sexes of the butterfly have tawny wings with veins
                        marked
                        with broad black bands. The male has a pouch on the hindwing. The margins of the wings are black
                        with
                        two rows of white spots. The underside of the wings resembles the upperside but is paler in
                        colouration.
                        The male common tiger has a prominent black-and-white spot on the underside of the hindwing. In
                        drier
                        regions the tawny part of the hindwing pales and approaches white in colour making it very

                        those
                        fortunate enough to encounter it. Found primarily in Singapore's tropical rainforests,

                There are more than 28,000 species of butterflies throughout the world. These insects live and breed in
                diverse habitats such as the mangroves, salt marshes, lowland forested areas, wetlands, mountain zones,
                and
                in grasslands. Butterflies tend to be habitat-specific meaning that some of the species will only be
                found
                in specific places such as only in the coastal areas or only in the mountain zones. The major role of
                butterflies in the ecosystem is that of pollination.

                        Butterflies are key indicators of ecosystem health, reflecting environmental changes like
                        habitat
                        loss
                        and climate change. As pollinators, they enhance biodiversity, supporting plant growth and
                        attracting
                        other animals, including invertebrates. Their sensitivity to environmental threats makes them
                        useful
                        for
                        monitoring ecosystem changes. A decline in butterfly populations or behavioral shifts can signal
                        potential ecological crises, such as habitat destruction or climate-related impacts.

                        As
                        they fly from flower to flower, they often deposit the pollen on another plant, allowing

                        Butterflies are an essential food source for many animals, including birds, bats, ants, mice,
                        and
                        other
                        insectivores. Their role in the food chain helps transfer nutrients across ecosystems,
                        connecting
                        vegetation, herbivores, omnivores, and microorganisms. A decline in butterfly populations can
                        lead
                        to a
                        ripple effect, reducing the populations of animals that depend on them, such as birds and mice.
                        For
                        example, the Blue Tit bird in Ireland consumes around 50 billion moth caterpillars annually.
